maybe try to present it as a table
tightly: gs, grid
         func1, [...]
         gs1, poly


loosely: gs1, poly
         func2, [...]

tightly case:
tightly: gs, grid
         func1, [...]
         gs1, poly
         write

loosely case:

tightly gs, grid
        transfer
loosely gs, grid
        func1 []
        gs1, poly/or other customized data type
        write, []


another one (hybrid case)

tightly: gs, grid
         func1, [...]
         gs1, poly
         cond [func2[...], transfer]

loosely: gs1, poly
         func2, [...]
         gs2, poly
         func3/write, [...]
